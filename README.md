# Ansible Automation Platform (AAP) 2.4 - eda.webhook - Listen on Different Endpoints

A sample rulebook that uses eda webhooks to listen for events.  Given the endpoint to
which the event is sent, call different playbooks to process the event.  The code
will delegate the events by sending the complete playload to the playbooks, which can
then do the processing.

There are two ways to call a playbook within a rulebook:
1. `run_playbook` :: Only supported with the `ansible-rulebook` cli.  This will not
work with the EDA Controller UI.
1. `run_job_template` :: This is supported by the EDA Controller UI, but requires
some configuration (detailed below).

## Running Locally

The script can be tested locally prior to creating an activation within the EDA UI.
This is useful to debug the playbooks.

### Install Rulebook

This assumes that you already installed python3 and pip and ansible.

Install ansible-rulebook an ansible.eda as follows:

```sh
%> pip install ansible-rulebook
%> ansible-galaxy collection install ansible.eda
```
### Run the Rulebook to Listen for Events

use `ansible-rulebook` to run the code.  Using the `-v` parameter will produce more
debug logs.

```sh
%> ansible-rulebook --rulebook rulebooks/generic-webhook-run_playbook.yml -i inventory.yml

2023-08-15 10:30:57,459 - ansible_rulebook.app - INFO - Starting sources
 ...
2023-08-15 10:30:58 331 [drools-async-evaluator-thread] INFO org.drools.ansible.rulebook.integration.api.io.RuleExecutorChannel - Async channel connected
```

### Send JSON Payload to Rulebook

use `curl` or similar tool to send a `POST` payload to the listening host.

#### Call the `splunk` endpoint as follows:
--------------------------------------

```sh
curl -d '{"summary": "Test to create TI issue from mule","description": "Mule Testing Jira Api one level of Module","type": "Incident","priority": "3-Medium","reporter": "ag","moduleMapLevels": {"parent": "Common to All Modules"}, "moduleMapAssets": [{"name": "Rates | IRD"},{"name": "CRD | CRD"}]}' -H "Content-Type: application" -X POST http://localhost:5000/splunk
```

#### Call the `web` endpoint as follows:
-----------------------------------

```sh
curl -d '{"warn":"2023-08-16T05:01:48.101-04:00  WARN 111934 --- [http-nio-0.0.0.0-8082-exec-5] o.s.web.servlet.PageNotFound : No mapping for GET /somepage.html"}' -H "Content-Type: application" -X POST http://localhost:5000/web
```

## Project and Activation from AAP EDA UI

Once everything looks good, configure the AAP EDA UI to create a project and a activiation.  This assumes
that you already installed AAP 2.4 that supports EDA.

In order for the playbooks to be called by the main rulebook (configured within the EDA Controller UI), you
must configure two templates with the main AAP Controller UI, namely `eda-template-splunk` and `eda-template-web` that will
be called by the EDA rulebook.  Therefore, you will need to:

1. [Configure AAP Controller UI](#configure-aap-controller-ui)
1. [Configure EDA Controller UI](#configure-eda-controller-ui)

### Configure AAP Controller UI

On the AAP Controller UI, create:

#### New Organization (or Use Default Organization)

From menu, `Access → Organizations`.  Click on `Add`.  You can also use the Default organization.

#### New Application

From menu, `Administration → Applications`.  Click on `Add`.  Use the following values.

|            |             |
|------------|-------------|
|Name        |A unique name|
|Organization|Select the Organization|
|Authorization grant type|Select `Resource owner password-based`|
|Client type|Select `Public`|

>> Access Token to be Used by EDA Controller UI
>>> From menu, `Access → Users`.  Click on the username (not the Action edit icon).
>>> On the `Tokens` tab, Add an new token.
 


1. Project Using the Github Source
1. New Inventory
1. Two Templates (eda-template-splunk and eda-template-web)



### Configure EDA Controller UI

### Create a Project

From the EDA AAP UI, create a Project as follows:
